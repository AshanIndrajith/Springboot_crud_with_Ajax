# Springboot_crud_with_Ajax
A Spring Boot CRUD application is a web application built using Java that can Create, Read, Update, and Delete data. It uses HTML to define the structure of the web pages, CSS to style them, and JavaScript with jQuery to add interactivity and make the application more user-friendly. Spring Boot simplifies the development process by handling much of the setup and providing useful features, while HTML,
CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery are used to create a visually appealing and interactive user interface.
